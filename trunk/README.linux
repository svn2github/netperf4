Until I can find a way to get the configure script ot add it
automagically, you need to define something along the lines of
_GNU_SOURCE in CPPFLAGS when doing the configure:

CPPFLAGS="-D_GNU_SOURCE" ./configure

Otherwise, the ever-so-helpful Linux (debian at least) build
environment will not find things like the posix_rwlock_t that are
seemingly so easily found on other platforms (eg HP-UX).
