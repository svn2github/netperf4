The configure script will try to use a command called xml2-config to
get the apripriate compiler and linker switches to include libxml2.
Often this is in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/lib is not always in
one's PATH variable.  So, it may be necessary to include
/usr/local/lib in the PATH variable before running the configure
script.
