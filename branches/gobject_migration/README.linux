It is no longer necessary to set CPPFLAGS before ./configure:

CPPFLAGS="-D_GNU_SOURCE" ./configure

As I've added some automagic stuff to the configure script to add
-D_GNU_SOURCE to the CPPFLAGS when configure runs.  In this way Linux
(debian at least) build environment can find things like the
posix_rwlock_t that are seemingly so easily found on other platforms
(eg HP-UX, MacOS X).
